	<p>Alternanthera dentata is a summer blooming plant that can range from different shades of red to different shades of purple. The names “alternans” and “anther” are derived from the Latin language. “Alternans” means alternating while “anthera” means anther. Anther is the part of the stamen that contains pollen. To care for the plant you need to keep your soil consistently moist but well drained. It is a summer blooming plant because the best color of the leaf is prominent when in full sun.

	<p>Amaranthus Caudatus is an annual summer blooming plant that is best known for the beautiful drooping red tassels. The tassels can also be gold but for the aesthetic of my garden I decided red is the color I prefer. For care of the plant it is best to keep the soil moist. The plants will last until the last frost. They can be held in hanging baskets but being planted is perfectly acceptable too.

	<p>Angelonia angustifolia is a summer blooming plant that’s colors range from blue to purple. This plant needs to be placed in an area that gets a lot of sunlight, much like the Alternanthera dentata. The flowers are similar to the snapdragon.

	<p>When I plant the Bellis perennis I will put it in a shadier part of the garden, the plant prefers cool temperatures. The soil must be cool and fertile. Due to this plant not being in favor of the summer heat I will plant it into a pot so it won’t die from the possibility of a drought. The rest of my plants are summer blooms but the Bellis perennis is a spring to early summer bloom. Bellis from Bellis perennis is the Latin word for “pretty”.

	<p>The Campanula americana is also known as the American Bellflower. This one, much like the Bellis perennis, also prefers shady and cooler areas. The soil must be kept rich, moist, and well drained. I will also plant the Campanula americana in a pot so it could be moved in the sun in the morning and moved to shade during the hot afternoons of summer. I will keep it relatively close to my garden because it attracts pollinators, it is considered a pollinator magnet.
